		<h2> Board and Training Packages </h2>
		
		<p>
		We offer several types of training packages.
		Whether your horse is completely green, needs a tune up, or is starting in a new discipline, we can customize a training package to meet your needs.
		</p>
		
		<h3> Full-Time Training </h3>
			
		<p>
		Horses in fulltime training are worked by our trainers five times a week, with goals tailored to the owner.
		Fulltime training includes full-board.
		</p>
			
		<h3> Part-Time Training </h3>
		<p>
		Horses in part-time training will be worked 3 times a week. 
		Part-time training can be packaged with full or partial care board.
		</p>
			
		<h3>Individual Training Sessions </h3>
		<p> 
		Individual training sessions are available for both boarders and clients who would like to haul in. 
		Individual training sessions are not packaged with board.
